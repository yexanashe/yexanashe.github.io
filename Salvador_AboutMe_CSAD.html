    <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
    <q style="background-color:#5c7ad6; color:white;">Early to post 20's</q>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>During my childhood</b>, I was carefree and had no worries at all.<sup>1</sup> I used to wander like a cat in the open fields, enjoying the natural beauty of the pastures.<sup>2</sup>
There are certain incidents that are still fresh in my memory.<sup>3</sup> For instance, at the age of seven, I tripped over a hump and my knees ended up with a huge abrasion.<sup>4</sup> I remember crying non-stop for almost an hour due to the pain.<sup>5</sup>
Once, a street performer came to our street, which was around our town’s fiesta.<sup>6</sup> I remember them breathing fire which left me in awe and later discovering that it was just gas and ignited as they spit the liquid out.<sup>7</sup> 
Another incident, which I still remember, is the swimming experience.<sup>8</sup> It was a Sunday when my family and I went for a picnic to a local resort.<sup>9</sup> Some of my cousins were expert swimmers but unluckily, I did not know how to swim.<sup>10</sup> My friends dived into the pool and compelled me to do the same.<sup>11</sup> Soon, I was caught by the current of water and was carried away at the center of the pool.<sup>12</sup> There was every possibility of my being drowned but due to the valour of one of my uncle, I was rescued and brought to the side of the pool.<sup>13</sup> I was very grateful to him because he gave me a new lease of life.<sup>14</sup>
The memories of my childhood days are still fresh in my mind.<sup>15</sup> Although I do wish that those days, full of pleasure, come back, I know that it is a thing of the past.<sup>16</sup></p><pre>Time flies on,
 as I grow older, 
 <strong>I look back with great nostalgia to my childhood days filled with fun and frolic.</strong><sup>17</sup> 
 I know they will never come back and hence I shall cherish those memories till my last day.<sup>18</sup> <i>
 Introducing a piece of my childhood.<sup>19</sup> The days I learned to dream and hope a little bit stronger.<sup>20</sup></i></pre>

    <h2 style="background-color:#6b82c7; color:white; font-family:garamond">Teenage Years</h2>
	<q style="background-color:#6b82c7; color:white;">2010 - 2020</q>
	<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some ways being a teenager is the hardest chapter in our life.</b><sup>1</sup> This is the part of our life where we’re trying <i>to define who we are not only to everyone around you, but also to yourself.</i><sup>2</sup> I remember struggling with my image, identity, self-confidence, and tons of emotional issues.<sup>3</sup>

Most of us look and act completely fine but everyone is going through something suicidal.<sup>4</sup> Decisions are not made “all of a sudden”, these feelings take time to work up to.<sup>5</sup> 
Sometimes I can’t sleep at night, because I feel empty.<sup>6</sup> The best way to explain this feeling is like you haven’t eaten in two days, but instead of that pain being in your stomach that, that pain is in your heart and you can’t just eat to feel full.<sup>7</sup> There are things, huge things, which I just don’t care about.<sup>8</sup> I don’t know what it is about being a teenager, maybe it’s all the raging hormones or perhaps the preprogrammed desire to displease our parents that seems to be in all of us that makes us want to do outrageous unnecessary things just for the fun of it.<sup>9</sup>
Being a teenager is so difficult that many of us wish we could just skip this chapter, and have everything figured out.<sup>10</sup> The truth is, however, you can’t skip around.<sup>11</sup> You have to go through this part and hopefully come out alive and happy.<sup>12</sup> In an ideal high school world everyone would be happy with the way they look and wouldn’t force themselves to become something else.<sup>13</sup> All of us would also have a voice, a strong voice to say exactly what we’re thinking.<sup>14</sup> We wouldn’t do things that didn’t matter to us, we would wait until they mattered then we would do those things with so much passion and devotion that there would be no question of right or wrong.<sup>15</sup> None of us would resort to suicide because we would all have unconventional support for one another.<sup>16</sup></p><pre> Unfortunately not all of this can happen because our world is not perfect or ideal.<sup>17</sup> 
We, teenagers have to bind together and strive for these things to happen and we all just have to push through our issues.<sup>18</sup> 
If we just keep pushing and hoping we will come out on the other side victorious.<sup>19</sup>
I like to think I have never bullied anyone and that I have many friends whom I fit in with.<sup>20</sup> 
However the fact is no matter how many friends I do have I am still an outsider to myself.<sup>21</sup> 
I have no idea who I want to grow up to be, or what I want to do, more importantly I have no idea who I am in this moment of time.<sup>22</sup>
We are never going to have everything figured out, not even when we are adults, so we just have to accept that and remember that this chapter, too, will end.<sup>23</sup> 

We will move on.<sup>24</sup> 
High school is not the end of us, it’s the introduction to real life, 
	and real life is what matters.<sup>25</sup> 
	
	<i>That was hard but it was fun, nonetheless.</i><sup>26</sup></pre>

    <h2 style="background-color:#808cb3; color:white; font-family:courier new">College Years</h2>
	<q style="background-color:#808cb3; color:white;">2020-present</q>
	<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole new different set-up, one step closer to reality.</b><sup>1</sup> Most people in their lifetime will have gone to college.<sup>2</sup> People go to college for all kinds of reasons.<sup>3</sup> Whatever the reason may be, almost everyone will have gone.<sup>4</sup> The biggest adaptation I have had to make in my life was moving to college.<sup>5</sup> Not only was it totally different from high school in relation to the content of classes and homework, but it was also completely different from my home life.<sup>6</sup> I was living on my own, with new surroundings, and new people.<sup>7</sup> Needless to say, this was something like I had never experienced before.<sup>8</sup>
             Generally, college classes aren't that much more difficult than high school courses.<sup>9</sup> The big difference is that in college I have to do all of my homework outside of class.<sup>10</sup> There's no study hall in college.<sup>11</sup> I have to take it upon myself to get to the library if needed or ask the necessary questions.<sup>12</sup> Another big difference between high school academics and college academics is the importance of the test.<sup>13</sup> Unlike in high school, where daily assignments can help to pad a grade, the main source of grading in college is the test.<sup>14</sup> I have only three tests per semester for each class.<sup>15</sup> Each test will count for close to one-third of my grade.<sup>16</sup> This puts me under a heavy burden to do well on each test.<sup>17</sup> Also, with all of the independence I have, homework and studying are not always my first priorities.<sup>18</sup> I would much rather spend time with my friends, watch television, or go to a party than do my schoolwork.<sup>19</sup>
			 here have been many times when I have put off doing an assignment until the night before.<sup>20</sup></p><pre> It is obvious that as a college student, I have had to adapt to a whole new style of learning.<sup>21</sup>
             Another thing that I have had to adapt to is living on my own.<sup>22</sup> 
			 Since I don't have a curfew anymore, I feel more independent than ever before.<sup>23</sup> 
			 I no longer have to worry about coming home late or telling anyone where I'm going to.<sup>24</sup>
			 Everything will be completely up to you now.<sup>25</sup>
			 
			 You, as an individual, 
			 
			 <i font color=red";>becomes what you decide to do.</i><sup>26</sup>
