		<pre style="text-align: center;">Maybe it's not my weekend but it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of watching while the minutes pass as I go nowhere
And this is my reaction to everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy, I don't wanna waste another minute here</pre>

	
	<h2>INDIE-POP</h2>
	<h3><span>Laro, by Autotelic</span> <span>Released: 2016</span></h3>
	<br>
		<p>“Laro,” from their debut album “Papunta Pabalik,” is one of those relatable songs. The song starts out innocently enough, describing an uneasy kind of relationship between two people, going back and forth between affection and apathy: “Puso natin ay patintero sa ulan, Pagsasama natin ay tagu-taguan.” The verse then moves on to describe the disparity between the two, yet they try to make something work regardless: “Langit ka, ako naman ay nasa lupa, Lulukso, baka sakali abutin.”</p>

	<pre style="text-align: center;">Buntong-hininga, 'di ba
Ang sarap makipaglaro?
Laro tayo ng
Mataya-taya, mataya-taya
Pagkabilang ng tatlo, takbo tayo papalayo
Mataya-taya, mataya-taya
isa, dalawa, tatlo, iiwanan mo ako</pre>

	<pre style="text-align: center;">Atashi no naka itsumo koe ni naranai yo
Honto wa tsutaetai no ni
"Betsuni sabishiku nante nai"
Sou itte sanzan tsuyogatta
Otona butte doko ka ni shimatte atta
Omoi wo kotoba ni dekitara
Kitto kitto fumidaseru</pre>
<br>
	<pre style="text-align: center;">There's a voice inside me that I can't suppress
What it really wants to say is
"I'm not particularly lonely."
Which would sound severely strong
Somewhere along the line, I've closed up the act of being a grown up
If I can transform my feelings into words
I'll certainly advance</pre>
