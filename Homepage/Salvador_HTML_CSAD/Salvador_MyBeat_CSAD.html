		<pre style="text-align: center;">Maybe it's not my weekend but it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of watching while the minutes pass as I go nowhere
And this is my reaction to everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy, I don't wanna waste another minute here</pre>

	
	<h2>INDIE-POP</h2>
	<h3><span>Laro, by Autotelic</span> <span>Released: 2016</span></h3>
	<br>
		<p>“Laro,” from their debut album “Papunta Pabalik,” is one of those relatable songs. The song starts out innocently enough, describing an uneasy kind of relationship between two people, going back and forth between affection and apathy: “Puso natin ay patintero sa ulan, Pagsasama natin ay tagu-taguan.” The verse then moves on to describe the disparity between the two, yet they try to make something work regardless: “Langit ka, ako naman ay nasa lupa, Lulukso, baka sakali abutin.”</p>

	<pre style="text-align: center;">Buntong-hininga, 'di ba
Ang sarap makipaglaro?
Laro tayo ng
Mataya-taya, mataya-taya
Pagkabilang ng tatlo, takbo tayo papalayo
Mataya-taya, mataya-taya
isa, dalawa, tatlo, iiwanan mo ako</pre>

	<pre style="text-align: center;">Atashi no naka itsumo koe ni naranai yo
Honto wa tsutaetai no ni
"Betsuni sabishiku nante nai"
Sou itte sanzan tsuyogatta
Otona butte doko ka ni shimatte atta
Omoi wo kotoba ni dekitara
Kitto kitto fumidaseru</pre>
<br>
	<pre style="text-align: center;">There's a voice inside me that I can't suppress
What it really wants to say is
"I'm not particularly lonely."
Which would sound severely strong
Somewhere along the line, I've closed up the act of being a grown up
If I can transform my feelings into words
I'll certainly advance</pre>
	
	<h2>K-POP</h2>
	<h3><span>About Love, by Red Velvet</span> <span>Released: 2017</span></h3>
	<p>About Love is a Korean song recorded by Red Velvet. It is the eighth track in the second full-length album Perfect Velvet and the eleventh track in the group's second full-length album repackage, The Perfect Red Velvet, following song Perfect 10 and before Moonlight Melody.</p>

	<pre style="text-align: center;">가끔 네게 말해
사랑은 아직 어려운 것 같다고
그럼 넌 그냥 (살짝) 나를 보고 (웃어)
아무 말 없이 가만 내 두 손을 따스히 감싸

이상해 너랑 있을 때면 단둘이 있을 때면
별일도 아닌 얘길 묻지도 않은 얘길 털어놔
그저 내 얘기에 귀를 기울여 주는 게
곁에 영원히 너는 내 편이 돼줄 것 같아

니 이름을 가만 불러보면
사랑한단 말 같아
숨길 수 없이 두근대
부르고 불러봐도 매일 그래
지금처럼 마주 보는 게
다 사랑인 것만 같아
이대로 우리 둘이만
시간이 멈췄으면 정말 좋겠어</pre>

<pre style="text-align: center;">Sometimes, I tell you that love is still hard for me
Then you just (slightly) look at me and (smile)
Without a word, you warmly hold my hands

It’s strange, when I’m with you, when it’s just us two
Things that aren’t a big deal, things you didn’t even ask about, I say it all
Just by listening to my stories
Makes me feel like you’re forever on my side

If I say your name
It feels like I’m saying I love you
I can’t hide it, my heart pounds
I call and call out to you but it’s like that every day
Looking at each other right now
Feels like love
I wish time would stop for just us two</pre>
